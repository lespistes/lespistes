# Les pistes: an unbounded distributed collaborative music

## Motivations

How could an unlimited number of people collaborate on one piece of music?

How could this happen with as little technology as possible?

How could this be accessible to as many people as possible? To people with little
money or technical knowledge or bandwidth? Without servers or software?

## The idea

A "piste" is a conceptual

(French for "path" or "track")

Clips of music are conceptually attached to one of a series of


Mike has a minute of music



## The details

Take all these definitions as conceptual, not technical, though technical
interpretations will appear.

A "recording" is some mechanical, electrical, electronic, digital or other thing that accurately reproduces a musical composition or performance.

"recording" does not mandate some sort of hardware or software or anything


A simple "tape" is a recording with a length and a start point in time.

A single "tape" is zero or more "recordings", each one attached to a point in time.
